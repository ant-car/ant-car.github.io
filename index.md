### About Me

I'm Anthony but everyone calls me Ac.  I have a degree in computer systems engineering and I've been playing around automating things since 2014.  

I have 5 years experience as a control system programmer.  My code runs in the background of board rooms, meeting rooms, courtrooms, lecture theatres and auditoriums. If the brands AMX, Crestron or Extron mean anything to you then I've been a certified programmer for their languages for at least 7 years.

After doing control systems programming for a few years I joined Thoughtworks as a consultant developer.  I've been playing around with Kotlin, Java, Python and AWS for a little while now.

My passion is around my smart home and it's why I've made this blog.
