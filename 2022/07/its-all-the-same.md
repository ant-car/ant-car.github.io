### It's all the same
What do:
- Arlec Grid Connect
- Mirabella Genio
- Kogan SmarterHome
- Lenovo
- Anko
all have in common?

They're made by the same whitebox manufacturer, Tuya!  Anko even advertises this on their packaging.

### Why should I care?

It's the same ecosystem which means **they will all work together by default!**  You just need to use the one app to manage them.  Pick an app and stick with it, I'd suggest the official Tuya app from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/tuya-smart/id1034649547) but if you're already using one of the other apps then stick with it.

### What can I do with this?
Get the right product for the job.  There are subtle variations between the products these companies offer, you can pick the item that's right for you knowing that it will integrate into your tuya smart home easily.

If you're in the zigbee space (when you have devices that need to connect to a hub instead of wifi) you can search Aliexpress for 'Tuya Zigbee' and find products not sold in Australia.  Please note: I'd advise agains anyhting that's connected to mains power at it likely hasn't been certified for use in Australia.
